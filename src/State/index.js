 * Cue.State - The granular reactivity engine behind Cue.
 *
 * Has the following built-in concepts:
 * - User defined modules have declarative default properties, computed properties and actions.
 * - Modules are blueprints from which state instances can be created using factory functions.
 * - Modules are like classes but specifically optimized for reactive state modeling.
 * - Modules can import other Modules which they extend themselves with.
 * - Property change interception (willChange handlers)
 * - Change reaction handling (didChange handlers and external reactions for side-effects)
 * - Chain-able and micro-optimized computed properties
