 * Injects State Providers directly into child state instances with a strong pointer when the child state has write-access to the provider.
 * A Provider is a state object that borrows properties to its descendents (consumers) when they inject data from an ancestor state into themselves.
 * Whenever a property in the state tree is mutated and that property has been provided to the mutating child state object, the mutation is forwarded to the providing ancestor state object.
 * @function injectProviders
 * @param {object}  childStateInternals   - the child state (__CUE__ internals) that injects providers into itself.
 * @param {Map}     providersToInstall    - Map of ProviderDescriptions {providerModuleName, providedPropertyName}
