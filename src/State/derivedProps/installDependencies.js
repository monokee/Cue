/**
 * Creates a dependency graph on the vDerivatives stored on a state module.
 * vDerivatives are used at runtime to quickly create instances of Derivatives.
 * Here we create a proxy object around the original config.props (allProperties) and call
 * the computations of the computed properties in the context of this proxy. The proxy will
 * intercept any "get" requests that the computations perform and thus figures out which properties
 * the computation depends on. As a convention it is encouraged that computations should destructure their dependencies from their first
 * function argument instead of dotting into "this" to ensure all dependencies are reached even when they are requested from within conditionals.
 * @function installDependencies
 * @param {Object}  allProperties       - config.props object containing both normal and computed properties.
 * @param {Map}     computedProperties  - Map of computed Properties -> vDerivatives.
