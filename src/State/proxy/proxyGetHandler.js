/**
 * Intercept "get" requests of properties in a reactive state object.
 * When prop is special symbol key, interceptor can return special data for recursive access etc.
 * Auto-wraps any sub-objects (Plain Objects and Arrays) into reactive proxies (unless they are the result of a computation).
 * Auto-creates -and caches intercepted array mutator functions when the get request is to an array mutator.
 * @function proxyGetHandler
 * @param   {object}            target  - The state instance from which a property is being requested.
 * @param   {(string|symbol)}   prop    - The property that is being requested.
 * @returns {*}                 value   - Either the plain state value or a special value when get request has been made to an internal symbol.
