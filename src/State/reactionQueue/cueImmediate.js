 * Called when state is mutated in a batch operation. Queues only the immediate reactions and derivatives of a mutated source property.
 * Explicitly collects the immediate derivatives of the mutated source properties on "accumulatedDerivatives" Array
 * so that the queueing of their subDerivatives (their dependency branch) can be deferred until the batch operation has finished.
 * Batch Op is detected -> Mutations call cueImmediate -> batch op finishes -> cueAccumulated is called -> react() is called.
 * @function cueImmediate
 * @external {Array} accumulatedDerivatives - Collects unique derivatives which were affected by source property mutation(s). Queueing of their subDerivatives is deferred.
