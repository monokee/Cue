 * Queues the subDerivatives of derivatives which have accumulated during a batch operation.
 * This method is called after a batch operation has finished and is an optimization that prevents unnecessary re-computations
 * of the dependency branch when there is a chance that one or many source properties are changed multiple times during a batch op (like actions).
 * @function cueAccumulated
 * @external {Array} accumulatedDerivatives - Contains unique derivatives which were affected by source property mutation(s). Their subDerivatives have not yet been queued.
