<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/main-desktop-browser-logos.png" width="200" alt="All major browsers">

<i>"Build blazingly fast, reactive web applications from reusable components that are fully driven by declarative
domain data. Cue extends <b>native WebComponents</b> with flux-like data binding and reactivity.
It lets you write vanilla javascript, does not require any build process and works in all modern browsers."</i>

#### A modern UI Library for the web of tomorrow.
Cue offers structure and high-performance reactivity while providing clean low-level access to the DOM.
It combines a lot of modern architectural approaches to scalable, domain-driven application development
in a single lightweight library for creating complex user interfaces. 
<ul>
  <li>üöÄ Works with the real DOM</li>
  <li>ü§Ø No extra template language</li>
  <li>üí© No procedural logic in markup ever (c-for, c-if directives etc)</li>
  <li>üòç Comprehensible structure by facilitating one-way data flow</li>
  <li>üõ∞ Fully observable data models with computations and side-effects</li>
</ul>

Cue creates native custom elements under the hood. Custom elements usually require the use of the class syntax and
provide no native data binding or reactivity. Cue extends custom elements with first class low-level reactivity, computed properties, one-way-data-flow,
blazingly fast list rendering (faster than any Virtual DOM alternatives), a familiar configuration object syntax and better lifecycle methods.
